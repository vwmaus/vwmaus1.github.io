I am a researcher at the Ecological Economics Institute of Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU) and at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). I have several years of experience in interdisciplinary research and active international cooperation. I hold a PhD in Earth System Science, a Master of Science degree in Computational Modelling and a Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Engineering. Currently at WU, I led an interdisciplinary team of PreDocs and student assistants for the ERC project [FINEPRINT](www.fineprint.global).
